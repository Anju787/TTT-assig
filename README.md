Inside the App function, the histogramData state variable and the setHistogramData setter function are declared using the useState hook. The initial value of histogramData is null.

The fetchData function is an asynchronous function that is triggered when the "Submit" button is clicked. It uses the axios library to make an HTTP GET request to the URL https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt and fetches the text content. The content is then processed to calculate the word frequencies. The top 20 words with the highest frequencies are extracted and stored in the chartData array. Finally, the chartData is set as the new value of the histogramData state using the setHistogramData function.

The exportToCSV function is triggered when the "Export" button is clicked. If the histogramData is not null, it converts the histogramData into a CSV format and initiates a file download using the saveAs function from the file-saver library. The downloaded file will be named "histogram_data.csv".

In the JSX part, the render function returns the JSX elements to be rendered. It contains a <div> element with the class name "App". Inside the <div>, there is a "Submit" button that triggers the fetchData function when clicked. Additionally, there is a conditional rendering block ({histogramData && ...}) that renders the histogram chart and an "Export" button if histogramData is not null.

Inside the conditional rendering block, the <BarChart> component from the recharts library is used to render the histogram chart. It receives the histogramData as the data prop and sets the width, height, and margins. The <CartesianGrid>, <XAxis>, <YAxis>, <Tooltip>, <Legend>, and <Bar> components are used to configure the appearance and behavior of the chart.

The "Export" button triggers the exportToCSV function when clicked.



libraries and plugins are used:

React: The core library for building user interfaces in React.

axios: A JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It is used to fetch the contents of the URL https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt.

recharts: A charting library for React that provides a set of customizable chart components. In this code, the following components are imported:

BarChart: The main chart component that renders a bar chart.
Bar: Represents a bar in the bar chart.
XAxis: Displays the x-axis labels.
YAxis: Displays the y-axis labels.
CartesianGrid: Renders the grid lines of the chart.
Tooltip: Displays tooltips for data points.
Legend: Displays a legend for the chart.
file-saver: A library that enables file downloads in the browser. In this code, the saveAs function is imported and used to save the histogram data as a CSV file.
